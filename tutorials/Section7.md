### Publishing the game
We want to be able to distribute the game and send it to people to play.

[Tutorial followed from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_17EAYX4Ac)

1. Now we've finished our game we want to present it to our players. One of the great things about unity is that once we have created out game we can deploy it to many different platforms (e.g. mac, windows, xbox, playstation)
2. First thing to do is to save our scene.
3. Next open the build settings window (File > Build Settings), this brings up the build settings window.
4. You can see here that there are a number of platforms which we can select from.

    Building a standalone will create an .exe or .dmg which can be run on a windows or mac computer. We want to change this to run in a browser because the school computers might not allow us to run a program.
5. Click on `Web Player` and press `Switch Platform`
6. Next we want to add the scene to be built, we can either drag & drop them from unity _or_ click on the `Add current` button to add the scene currently loaded.
7. Now click on build and select a destination.
8. You can see that two files have been created. A HTML file (which is a web-page containing our game) and a .UNITY3D file which contains our game code.
9. Open the html file and test the game.
10. We could now upload these files (both of them) to a website so that anyone could play our game in their browser.

Though these assignments have been a very simple example, they cover a _lot_ of the basics that you will need to create your own games. And will give you a basic understanding of the concepts & features of Unity.

Have fun creating your own games!
